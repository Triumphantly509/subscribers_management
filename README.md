With the help of this software, users can subscribe to newsletters by entering their email addresses. 
The email list may receive a targeted email.
Whenever, a user can opt out. A user's email address won't be destroyed if they unsubscribe; instead, the status will be changed from True to False. 
The user who unsubscribed will no longer receive emails from the newsletter.
If a user wants to resubscribe after being unsubscribed, it will be possible; however if the email exists and the status is True, an existed email will not be able to resubscribe.
A dashboard is offered to provide precise information on the quantity of emails that are subscribed, new this month, and unsubscribed. Also displayed will be the timestamp and the updated times, which will reveal when the user subscribed and unsubscribed.
